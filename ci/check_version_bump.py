"""Fail if a component's packaged files changed without a version bump.

For every component declared in .github/workflows/upload_components.yml
(except the repo root, which packages the whole tree) this compares the
files under the component against the target branch. If any changed but
the `version:` in its idf_component.yml was not bumped, a new version
would never reach the registry (the action skips already-published
versions) -- so fail CI here, loudly, instead of shipping a silent no-op.

Opt-out: include the token "[skip-version-bump]" in any commit message in
the merge request's range to mark the change as intentional (e.g. a docs
or badge tweak you don't want to publish as a release). The check then
reports what it found and passes.

The component list and name resolution are shared with
validate_components.py so both jobs agree on what a "component" is.
